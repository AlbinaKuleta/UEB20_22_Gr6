        Video games have a lot of potential on a cognitive level,
        and can also serve as a rehabilitation tool. 
        There are video consoles that have platforms such as the Wii Balance Board that
        allow the improvement of mobility in the joints, balance, visual-manual coordination,
        physical resistance and reflexes.
        Some games also allow group participation of people with different disabilities,
        encouraging inclusiveness. "Wii Therapy" should be practiced in socio-health centres 
        or similar, and always under the supervision of physiotherapists to
        make the most out of it.
