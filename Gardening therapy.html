        Therapeutic gardens and allotments are used as an activity for 
        people with physical and intellectual disabilities, for both therapeutic 
        and recreational purposes. The benefits of creating or actively participating 
        in the care and conservation of a garden or allotment are related to the emotional 
        bond that each person establishes with the plants and the natural environment. 
        Therefore, "therapeutic gardening" brings with it a series of physical, emotional and
        cognitive benefits that can relieve tension and reduce stress.
