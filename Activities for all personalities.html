     There are some popular adapted sports (wheelchair tennis and basketball, 
     adapted rugby and hand cycling, among others) that people with disabilities really enjoy.
     You can find a lot of adapted sports' followers and tournaments, so it 
     will be easy for anyone to find companion to practice with. 
     Accessible tourism is another excellent option to stay active. 
     Many cities are improving their infrastructures to have a good impact on the lifes of
     disabled people. Don't miss it!
     In terms of culture, there are a lot of alternatives: 
     adapted museums and accessible heritage sites, and the popular therapeutic routes,
     which are intended to enhance other senses in people with sensory impairments.
     These are the most popular, but there are many other activities adapted for people with 
     disabilities in which the degree of disability and age are not a major concern.
