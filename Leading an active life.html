 Activities for people with disabilities are important for many reasons, 
but here we will discuss two. The first is that they are good on a physical 
and psychological level; the second is that many of them are designed to be carried out in groups,
 both with disabled people and others who are not, so they serve as the backbone of 
 social relationships, allowing you to meet people and move both physically and socially outside 
 your usual environment.
On the other hand, you must bear in mind that physical-recreational activities and 
exercise can help you burn calories and maintain muscle tone. This means, in that sense, 
any activity, even of low intensity, is positive and helps to accelerate metabolism.
Other benefits that you can notice in your health if you lead an active life are the improvement of
 your blood circulation, and getting to sleep more easily. On a psychological level, activity will
 increase your ability to concentrate and reduce stress.
