        Water has been used as a therapeutic tool for years, and the practice of 
        aquatic activities has a strong linkage with health enhancement.
        That is the reason why it is practiced by a lot of people and it is one of the
        most common adapted sports for people with physical disabilities.
        Aqua-gym, swimming, passive stretching and therapeutic hydrotherapy are some of 
        the examples of activities that significantly enhance functional ability,
        psychomotor skills and physical condition of the participants.
        These activities are especially useful in the rehabilitation or treatment of 
        pathologies that have a neurological origin, such as spinal cord injuries, head trauma, 
        cerebrovascular accidents, degenerative diseases of the neurological system,
         spinal atrophies or spina bifida.
